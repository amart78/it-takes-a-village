# It Takes a Village - character catalog application

It Takes a Village is a character catalog application that lists character details for ‘villagers’ from Nintendo’s popular video game series, “Animal Crossing”. I was inspired to create this app as Animal Crossing has been a favorite game series of mine since it first debuted on GameCube.

 It Takes a Village allows for the user to browse characters, search for specific villagers, save their favorite characters to a ‘My Favorite’s' page, and track which villagers currently reside in their town. This is helpful for users as it is common for players to want to learn more about characters and make a plan for which villagers they’d like to try to get to move to their town.
